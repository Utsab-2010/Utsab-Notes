1. All linear combinations of independent Gaussian RVs are Gaussian
2. A  Gaussian random vector is a random vector all of whose linear projections are Gaussian.
3. If $\underline{X}$ is Gaussian , then
	1. $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are independent $equivalent$ Cov(Xi,Xj)=0 (uncorrelated)

4. RVs are jointly Gaussian if they constitute a Gaussian random vector.
5. It is possible for random variables to be individually Gaussian but not jointly Gaussian. Jointly Gaussian is a stronger property.
6.
