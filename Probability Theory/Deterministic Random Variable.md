A random variable $X$ is said to be deterministic (or **degenerate**) if there exists some constant $c$ such that the probability of $X$ being equal to $c$ is exactly $1$.

Mathematically:

$$P(X = c) = 1$$

In this case, the probability of any other value occurring is zero.

Essentially, it is not "random" but to be inclusive in the definition we have this case where it's deterministic.
