Neural implicit fields (or [Implicit Neural Representations - INRs](https://www.google.com/search?q=Implicit+Neural+Representations+-+INRs&sxsrf=ANbL-n4hW9CDmn9cG2GwJK5RLn_D3vNUeg%3A1770824656406&uact=5&ved=2ahUKEwi4z6Dj5NGSAxWw-zgGHagiEWcQgK4QegQIARAD)) are a machine learning paradigm that represents data—such as 3D shapes, images, or scenes—as a continuous function parameterized by a neural network rather than discrete grids or pixels. They map coordinates (e.g.
(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) ) to signal values (e.g., color, density, or distance), enabling high-fidelity, compact storage, and resolution-independent rendering of complex data.
